I am a third-year\n                  Information Technology major at the University of Cincinnati.\n                  I am also a software developer, and currently I work at the UC\n                  IT Solutions Center.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I was introduced into this world on the 9th of May 1999, the\n                  last summer of the millenium, in the beautiful and diverse\n                  country of India. I was born to highly socially active\n                  parents, with a large age gap between me and all of my older\n                  cousins, including my brother. These factors made me a very\n                  socially-awkward person. So I spent most of my life trying to\n                  overcome my social anxiety, but never truly succeeded.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I got interested into the field of computer science very\n                  early, when my brother introduced my to something called\n                  \"C++\". The power of making a computer do whatever I wanted\n                  through text commands felt amazing. That's when my love of\n                  learning kicked in, which made me spend hours everyday\n                  learning about programming and software development. School\n                  was boring, so I had a lot of time to dedicate to my newfound\n                  love.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  I am a problem solver. I have always been attracted to puzzles\n                  and riddles. I like how they compel you to move all the gears\n                  of your brain for one purpose - search for a solution. And\n                  successfully finding the solution is highly rewarding. This is\n                  why I was attracted to the Information Technology program -\n                  most of it is problem solving.\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"text-center\">\n                  <a href={resume} target=\"_blank\">\n                    Check out my resume here!\n                  </a>\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
