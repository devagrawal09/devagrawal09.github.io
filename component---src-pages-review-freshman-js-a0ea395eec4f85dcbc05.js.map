My second reaction was{\" \"}\n                  <em>\n                    \"This has been such a crazy year, can I even fit it into a\n                    few hundred words?\"\n                  </em>\n                  . Regardless of the answer, I am going to try.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Which is pretty much how the last year (and a few months\n                  before it) has been. I see an opportunity, I ask myself,{\" \"}\n                  <em>\n                    \"Dev this is crazy, are you sure you want to do this?\"\n                  </em>\n                  . Then I go for it. The biggest of them all was my decision to\n                  spend thousands of dollars and travel thousands of miles away\n                  from my family, friends and girlfriend, for college education.\n                  Was it crazy? I am not even answering that question. Did it\n                  pay off? Definetely!\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The year started out with a lot of excitement as I was looking\n                  forward to my life in a new country filled with strange people\n                  and awesome opportunities. Strangely though, I did not feel\n                  any anxiety or fear of living alone like I was told by others\n                  who have went through the same thing. That is, until I was on\n                  the plane headed for Cincy. I was completely fine, watching\n                  Young Sheldon and listening to my staple death metal songs,\n                  until my neighbour pulled up the map on the screen in front of\n                  us that displayed the current location of the flight. At that\n                  time, we were just crossing the Atlantic into east coast.\n                  Looking at that hit me with a wave of anxiety like I had never\n                  experienced before. That image somehow made the whole\n                  experience real and scary, and all I could think about was\n                  waking up in a completely strange town with no idea of what to\n                  do or who to talk to. I'm still not sure when or how I\n                  shrugged off that feeling. All I know that it came, made its\n                  mark, left, and never came back.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Continuing on the theme of crazy things that happened, the\n                  craziest thing you can do to an introvert is to trap them in a\n                  room with a complete stranger. I had spent most of my time\n                  alone, so having a roommate was a new experience, one that I\n                  was not looking forward to. But lucky for me, my roommate\n                  seemed to respect my introverted nature, so we established a\n                  mutually beneficial no-talk business-only relationship. Making\n                  friends was never my strong suite, but I tried. Tried and\n                  failed. Just like I had been doing for the last 7 years. I did\n                  make a couple good friends eventually, and somehow I got\n                  better at creating and managing my social life. I have a few\n                  special people to thank for that.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  My academic and professional life were way better than I\n                  expected. I did not imagine that I would see so many\n                  opportunities that I would have to think twice before starting\n                  something new. So many organizations to get involved in, so\n                  many projects to chime in, so many assignments to complete, so\n                  many people to meet. It was crazy (no surprise there), and I\n                  did not know where to start. Again, took my some time, but\n                  eventually I found my way around the campus life. I got an\n                  interesting job, became a core member of a student\n                  organization, made nice connections and got to travel a bit.\n                  University Honors helped quite a bit. From the Gateway to\n                  Honors class to my first Honors experience, I learnt a lot of\n                  life skills that I have now incorporated into my everyday\n                  routine.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  So what now? I have been asking myself that question for\n                  several days now, so it's probably time I give it some serious\n                  thought. Now that the crazy part is out of the way\n                  (hopefully), it's time to flourish. Flourish my academic life\n                  by aiming for a higher GPA (not completely satisfied with my\n                  last 3.6), and flourish my professional life by making\n                  expanding my skillset, connections and opportunities. Student\n                  clubs are a great way to make connections, so getting involved\n                  in some is definitely in my todo-list. I also need to connect\n                  with some seniors and faculty members. The School of IT is an\n                  awesome and student-friendly community, and I plan to make the\n                  most of it.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Probably the most important thing to do is to stay open and\n                  flexible. The future is unpredictable, and the more you plan,\n                  the more it goes against you. So the hope is that nothing goes\n                  wrong and my mission to flourish is achieved. But if I am\n                  flexible enough, I can make those wrong things work in my\n                  favor. This is another skill I have yet to pick up.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  <em>Hoping for one more crazy year!</em>\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default FreshmanYearPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
