I am a third-year Information Technology major at the University of Cincinnati. I am also a software developer, and currently I work at the UC IT Solutions Center.\n              </p>\n                <p>\n                  I was introduced into this world on the 9th of May 1999, the last summer of the millenium, in the beautiful and diverse country of India. I was born to highly socially active parents, with a large age gap between me and all of my older cousins, including my brother. These factors made me a very socially-awkward person. So I spent most of my life trying to overcome my social anxiety, but never truly succeeded.\n              </p>\n                <p>\n                  I got interested into the field of computer science very early, when my brother introduced my to something called \"C++\". The power of making a computer do whatever I wanted through text commands felt amazing. That's when my love  of learning kicked in, which made me spend hours everyday learning about programming and software development. School was boring, so I had a lot of time to dedicate to my newfound love.\n              </p>\n                <p>\n                  I am a problem solver. I have always been attracted to puzzles and riddles. I like how they compel you to move all the gears of your brain for one purpose - search for a solution. And successfully finding the solution is highly rewarding. This is why I was attracted to the Information Technology program - most of it is problem solving.\n              </p>\n                <p className=\"text-center\">\n                  <a href={resume} target=\"_blank\">Check out my resume here!</a>\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/about-2a0a1f0878c4bb1972bd1bb22ec72b8c.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/resume-e55387cc7ff63b6cb15fd44c56f7de84.pdf\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
