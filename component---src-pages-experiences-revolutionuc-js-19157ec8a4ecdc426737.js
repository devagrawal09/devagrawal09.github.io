I have been an executive member of the organization for 2 years, and I volunteered for organizing RevolutionUC both years. RevolutionUC organizers are split into 4 teams â€“ Logistics, Sponsorship, Marketing, and Web. This year, I was given the opportunity to be the lead of the Web team, and I was equal parts excited and scared for this.

The rest of the day was all about talking to attendees on our Discord, helping participants with projects, and making new connections. We had over 230 participants from 11 countries, in addition to representatives from sponsor companies, mentors from the industry, and qualified judges. A bunch of mini-events were hosted for the attendees to take a break and socialize."),n.createElement("p",null,"This experience helped me develop myself in not just one or two, but all of the 5 UHP competencies.

I can put this on my resume and showcase to potential employers. I am sure they will be interested in someone who can manage a system of this scale, as well as the soft skills that come with leading a team and organizing an event."))))))))}}}]);
